    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <h2>Functionality is how accurately the code works to how it is intended to work, mainly checked by testing and looking over code. This implication is vital as people would not 
        want to play a game that does not function as intended. Issues can arise with the functionality when syntax errors, which is when code is incorrectly written, are made or 
        from logic errors, a piece of code that functions but not in the way it was meant to. </h2>
    <br>
    <h2>For this project, I will address the functionality by testing the encounter loop in its entirety multiple times over so that it functions as intended, stopping any bugs from 
        breaking a vital part of the game. 
        I also will use all the given options during these playthroughs, such as any stores, to check that none of them are broken.
        Along with those, I will check the lesser mass of the game including the introduction of the game and the boss fight at the end of the game.</h2>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <h2>The usability of a project is based not on how functional it is, but on how user friendly it is. A game that is difficult to use because of no other reason than poor 
        design won’t be fun. So, the assumed users must be given the proper game design. This is usually harmed when an interface or controls are hard to figure out how to use or 
        irrationally different than the usual methods of doing things (e.g. requiring the user to type ‘END’ at the end of their input would be unnecessary and only cause issues 
        for players as it just isn’t done, for obvious reasons.)</h2>
    <h2>To make sure the usability is good, all the text will be checked that it is formatted correctly and in a way that is easy to digest, where paragraph breaks are added to 
        split up separate points which should be clearly shown and stated. I will check this both in the code but more so while playtesting to understand what the perspective would 
        be as a player rather than a developer.
        This will also be made sure of as I will ask people uninvolved with the project to test it, getting an unbiased opinion of the playability and usability of the game.</h2>

    <h3>Ethics</h3>
    <h2>The matter of ethics in a game is important as if you want to create a game with depictions of mature topics, such as violence, you have to be responsible and provide 
        adequate warnings beforehand so people don’t see things they didn’t want to. This is relevant to this project as it is planned to have graphic depictions of violence, 
        up to a certain point.</h2>
    <h2>I plan to address this by creating a warning message beforehand with everything that could be potentially unsuitable for certain audiences and an acknowledgement of the 
        contents of the game before proceeding. It will be the very first thing that happens in the game so that everyone sees it and is aware of the nature of the game.</h2>
