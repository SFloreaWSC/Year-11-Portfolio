    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <h2>For the most visually appealing end result I made sure to use colors that aren’t harsh, don’t clash poorly, and create a professional look. The project 1 and 2 pages weren’t linked to anything originally, but I felt it wasn’t the best choice to have them send you to an error page, so I created an ‘in construction’ page so that it both looked and felt better. To make sure that I achieved this I got advice from multiple people on what looked good and what could be improved.  Using this feedback I altered colors a bit, changed the font, borders to the images, and changed the size of some text.

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <h2>By consistently testing my site as I developed it, I ensured the fact that it remains functional throughout. Since I was worried about the side navigation bar, I checked it frequently, and I’m glad I did. There was a syntax error in my code that made the navigation bar break off of the top one, but I caught it early. I also made sure to check every link on every page so that I knew they worked and were in the correct order.  Those, along with other checks and fixes, made sure that the end result showcases my actual abilities and does not get ruined by some missed bug.

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <h2>Even though a website could look well made, and is completely functional, if someone tries to use it they would very quickly find out how usable it is. For the sake of usability I put a title for each page to identify it at a glance, and subtitles for each section. I decided to add not only a top navigation bar, but also a side one for usability. This separated the projects from the individual pages and gave you access to them when in any page. Because the bar is so versatile, it can also be used for other project pages easily. After making choices to improve the usability, I got external testers of different skill levels to use the website and decide whether it has good usability or not.
