    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <h2>For the most visually appealing end result I made sure to use colors that aren’t harsh, don’t clash poorly, and create a professional look. To make sure that I achieve this I got outside advice from multiple people on what is good and what could be improved.
    </h2>
    <hr class="abcd">
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <h2>By consistently testing my site as I developed it, I ensured the fact that it remains functional throughout. This made sure that the end result showcases my actual abilities and does not get ruined by some missed bug.
    </h2>
    <hr class="abcd">
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <h2>Even though a website looks well made, and is completely functional, if someone tries to use it they would very quickly find out how usable it is. My choice to make sure that the website remains usable for a wide range of users was to get a range of external testers, of different skill levels, to use the website and decide whether it has good usability or not.
