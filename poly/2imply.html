    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <h2>For this project, aesthetics are important as a viewer wouldn't want to continuously watch a poorly designed character do whatever it is
        made to do, and is also the first thing that a viewer will usually look at so a visually appealing first impression is ideal.

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <h2>The importance of functionality comes from the fact that a broken mess is not going to appeal to the target demographic, unless that was
        what the demographic wants, and so a functional end result has to be accomplished to be succesful.

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <h2>While a beautiful, functional result may be succesful, it won't last. Even though people often get things that they like because they work
        and look good, they will almost always move on once a newer, prettier, thing comes across. This means that the actual usability is vital
        for long term success of end goal(s).
