    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <h2>The aesthetics of something relates to how it appears visually, such as the style, colors, ect. For this project, aesthetics are important 
        as a viewer wouldn't want to continuously watch a poorly designed character do whatever it is made to do, and is also the first thing that 
        a viewer will usually look at so a visually appealing first impression is ideal. Since the character is a human, making sure the aesthetics
        are good means making sure the body is proportional to itself, so the legs shouldn't be thin if the arms are huge and the head isn't too 
        small or large for the body. Along with the body, if clothing is added to the character, it should be layed correctly on the body, and not 
        too unrealistically draped on the character.

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <h2>Functionality is how well the product works, like if when you click a link, it actually takes you there. The importance of functionality 
        comes from the fact that a broken mess is not going to appeal to the target demographic, so a functional end result has to be accomplished 
        to be succesful. I will make sure this project is functional by making sure the skeleton is correctly layed out in the character, and has
        covered all necessary areas, such as fingers, feet, ect. This will also make sure the animation will be natural as the skeleton should be layed out in a way that means the 
        character's limbs would move as human-like as possible.

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <h2>A project's usability is about the process in which it functions. For example, a keyboard could be functional, but if all the keys were in 
        different places than the standard ones, it wouldn't be very usable. While a beautiful, functional result may be succesful, it usually 
        doesn't last. Though people often get things that they like because they function and look good, they will almost always move on once a 
        newer, prettier, thing comes across. This means that the actual usability is vital for long term success of end goal(s).
