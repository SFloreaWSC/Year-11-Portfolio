        <h3>This website is a portfolio which I created to show potential future IT employers, especially those in software engineering and 
            game development, what I've done. This can be a look at my past projects to get an understanding of what I can do and how I work, 
            by displaying my skills, experience, and how I complete and/or organize my work.
        </h3>
        <h3>For example, from this portfolio an employer could see that I know HTML and CSS, that I like having a more neutral base with a pop 
            of color as the complimentary color, and how I organized my pages with the top and side navigation bar. If they look further they could
             even see how I organized the code itself like the names of pages, images, how the code is layed out, how my css works together, ect.
        </h3>
